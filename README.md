What is this?<br>
It's a simple volume controller, that can be used together with window managers, like xmonad.<br>
There's no need for it on a full-blown desktop environment, like KDE or GNOME, since they already have a similar feature built in.

How does it work?<br>
An icon shows in the system tray, and a dialog appears when it's clicked, where you can control the volume of the default input and output devices.
